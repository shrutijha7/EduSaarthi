Q1: The study of Instruction Formats, Stack organization, and various Addressing Modes are all categorized under the Central processing unit topics within Unit II.
Answer: True
Explanation: Unit II explicitly groups Stack organization, Instruction Formats, and Addressing Modes as components of the Central processing unit discussion.

Q2: The comparison between Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architectures is a primary focus area of Unit III, not Unit II.
Answer: False
Explanation: Unit II explicitly lists both CISC and RISC, along with the comparison 'CISC vs RISC,' as part of its content related to basic computer organization and design.

Q3: Unit II covers the Instruction codes, Computer Registers, and the Instruction cycle, but excludes the mechanism of Input-Output and interrupt handling.
Answer: False
Explanation: Unit II explicitly includes 'Input-Output and interrupt' as a topic, listed alongside Timing and Control and Memory-Reference Instructions.

Q4: The detailed discussion of Arithmetic Micro-Operations, Logic Micro-Operations, and Shift Micro-Operations is included as part of the BASIC COMPUTER ORGANIZATION AND DESIGN content in Unit II.
Answer: False
Explanation: These specific types of micro-operations (Arithmetic, Logic, Shift) are listed as core components of Unit III, under 'REGISTER TRANSFER AND MICRO-OPERATIONS,' not Unit II.

Q5: Data Transfer and Manipulation is a specific topic covered in Unit II, preceding the comparison between CISC and RISC architectures.
Answer: True
Explanation: Unit II lists 'Data Transfer and Manipulation' immediately before the introduction of Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC).
