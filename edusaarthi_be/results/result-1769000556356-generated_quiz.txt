Q1: What is the defining characteristic of the Von-Neumann architecture regarding program instructions and data?
   A) Instructions and data share a single address space and bus.
   B) Instructions are stored in ROM while data is stored in RAM.
   C) Separate buses are used for memory access and I/O transfers.
   D) A dedicated control bus manages only instruction fetching.

Q2: Which technique is used in data representation to ensure integrity during transmission or storage by appending redundant bits?
   A) Fixed-point normalization
   B) Floating-point rounding
