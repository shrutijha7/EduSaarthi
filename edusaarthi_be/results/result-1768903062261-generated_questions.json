    "Analyze the inherent limitations of the classical stored-program architecture regarding instruction and data flow, and explain how modern multiprocessor systems attempt to mitigate this fundamental bottleneck through architectural or memory management strategies.",
    "Compare the fundamental design philosophies of complex instruction sets (CISC) and reduced instruction sets (RISC). Justify why a highly pipelined processor architecture typically favors a RISC approach, focusing on instruction uniformality and addressing mode complexity.",
    "Contrast the operational flexibility and execution speed of a hardwired control unit versus a micro-programmed control unit. Provide a scenario where the complexity of implementing new arithmetic or logic micro-operations would mandate the use of micro-programming.",
    "Discuss the necessity of cache coherence protocols in shared-memory multiprocessor systems. Detail the specific problems that arise when multiple processing elements attempt to access and modify the same data block within a multi-level memory hierarchy, particularly concerning write operations.",
    "Explain the crucial difference in CPU utilization between Programmed I/O and Direct Memory Access (DMA) techniques for high-volume data transfers. Under what specific conditions would an operating system designer choose to implement Interrupt Driven I/O over DMA, despite the potential for lower throughput?"
