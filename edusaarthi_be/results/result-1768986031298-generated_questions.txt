1. Analyze the inherent throughput bottleneck created by the unified address and data space in the Von-Neumann model, and discuss how modern architectures mitigate this constraint to enhance parallel execution.
2. Explain the trade-offs between magnitude range and precision when implementing the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, detailing the logical steps required for normalization during addition or subtraction.
3. Contrast the architectural philosophy of Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) versus Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) in terms of instruction decoding complexity, register utilization, and suitability for deep pipelined execution.
4. Justify the necessity of multiple addressing modes within an instruction set architecture, explaining how advanced modes (e.g., indexed or relative) facilitate efficient stack management and support complex data structure manipulation.
5. Detail the logical structure required to integrate arithmetic, logic, and shift micro-operations into a single, efficient hardware component, focusing on the role of selection circuitry and control signals.
6. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of implementing the control unit using micro-programming versus hardwired control, particularly concerning system flexibility, design complexity, and instruction execution speed.
7. Critically evaluate the impact of different cache mapping techniques (direct, associative, set-associative) on the hit ratio and overall system performance, considering the overhead associated with replacement policies.
8. Describe the mechanism of demand paging within a virtual memory system, and analyze the potential performance degradation caused by a high page fault rate, including the concept of thrashing.
9. Under what operational conditions is Direct Memory Access (DMA) significantly more advantageous than interrupt-driven I/O, and what are the essential hardware components required for DMA transfer initiation and completion?
10. In a shared-memory multiprocessor system, explain the necessity of cache coherence protocols, illustrating how a common snooping protocol maintains data consistency across multiple processing elements.
