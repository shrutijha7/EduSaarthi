1. Contrast the architectural philosophy regarding complexity in instruction set design. Specifically, how does the typical instruction format and reliance on complex addressing modes in a CISC machine impact compiler design and pipeline efficiency compared to the fixed-length, load/store architecture of a RISC system?
2. Given the fundamental separation of program storage and data storage in the classic Von-Neumann model, analyze the inherent trade-offs between cost, latency, and throughput when designing bus structures to mitigate the performance bottleneck imposed by sequential instruction fetching and execution.
3. Evaluate the flexibility and performance implications of implementing the central control unit using micro-programming versus a hardwired approach. Under what specific conditions (e.g., frequent instruction set modifications or highly complex sequencing logic) does the use of Control Memory become the superior design choice?
4. Critically analyze the role of the principle of locality in the effective operation of a virtual memory system utilizing paging. Explain how the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) interacts with the cache hierarchy to maintain high performance despite the indirection introduced by the virtual addressing scheme.
5. When multiple processing units share a common main memory, explain the necessity of cache coherence protocols. Detail the challenges involved in maintaining data consistency across private caches and discuss the fundamental differences between directory-based and snooping mechanisms in achieving inter-processor synchronization.
