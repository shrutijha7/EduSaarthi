1. Analyze the architectural trade-offs between Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC), specifically focusing on how instruction density and micro-programmed control complexity impact pipeline design efficiency.
2. In a shared-memory multiprocessor system, explain the necessity of cache coherence protocols. Detail the mechanism by which a snooping protocol ensures data consistency when multiple processors attempt to modify the same block of memory simultaneously.
3. Discuss the role of paging in virtual memory management, explaining how translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) mitigate the performance overhead associated with mapping virtual addresses to physical memory locations.
4. Explain the inherent design challenges in implementing a purely hardwired control unit for a complex instruction set, and detail how micro-programmed control provides a more flexible and structured solution for instruction execution sequencing.
5. Contrast Direct Memory Access (DMA) with Programmed I/O in terms of CPU utilization and throughput for high-volume data transfers. Under what circumstances would an Interrupt Driven I/O approach be preferred over DMA?
